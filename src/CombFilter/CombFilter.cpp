#include "CombFilter.h"

using namespace std;

//Inspired by CAudioFileIf/CAudioFile, 
//create the files CombFilter.h/.cpp in the 
//appropriate folder locations and populate them 
//with your classes/functions etc. 
//The CombFilterIf.h header contains a 
//declaration of the CCombFilterBase class. 
//This class must be defined in CombFilter.h. 
//Note: when adding files to the directory, 
//CMake must be run again in order to view the files in the built project.
